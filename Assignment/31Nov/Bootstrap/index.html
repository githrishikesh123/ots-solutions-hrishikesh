2. jQuery is removed completely: ==========> 
    Earlier, bootstrap components like
    modals, tooltips, popovers etc, were dependent on jQuery and popper.js. After
    the release of the alpha 5 version, Bootstrap no longer depends on jQuery. While
    jQuery has been used in Bootstrap for more than 8 years, many developers had
